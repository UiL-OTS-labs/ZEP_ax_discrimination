 * Before reading this file, here is a note about terminology.
 * 
 * Variables with ex1 in the variable name are regard the first experiment.
 * Variables with ex2 and ex3, regard the second and third experiment respectively.
 *
 * This experiment always presents the first experiment first. However,
 * the order of the second and third experiments is
 * counterbalanced. This means that a variable mentioning
 * the third experiment (a variable with ex3 in its name) might 
 * actually be presented as second experiment.
